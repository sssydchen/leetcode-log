## 232. Implement Queue using Stacks (easy)
Stack: Last in first out (LIFO)
Queue: First in first out (FIFO)
To achieve the pop function of a queue, pop the elements in the input stack and append them to the output stack, and pop from the output stack;

## 225. Implement Stack using Queues (easy)
Can use one or two queues:
If using two queues, pop elements in the input queue and append them to the output queue, and pop from the output queue;
If using only one queue, pop elements in the queue and append them one by one to this queue (therefore reversed the order), and pop all elements.

## 20. Valid Parentheses (easy)
Stack application
Three cases;

## 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String (easy)
Stack or two pointers
